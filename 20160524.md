### The Arctic Ocean
1. Definition vary
2. Occupy most of the area north of 70°N
3. Limited connections to the word's oceans
4. Stability of surface waters is determined by salinity rather than temperature
5. Strong stability and low salinity favor sea ice formation
### Sea Ice
1. Sea ice alters heat and momentum transfers between atmosphere and ocean
2. Coupled with atmosphere energy budget and circulation
3. High albedo, which depends on snow cover
4. Strong seasonality > Sept minimum and March maximum
5. A few regions are ice-free even in late winter
### The Arctic atmosphere
1. Major features: Siberian high, Icelandic low, Aleutian low
2. Surface air temperature modulated by air-sea fluxes over open ocean and heat fluxes
3. Very cloudy, 60~80% over central Arctic
4. Strong low-level inversions, especially during the winter 
5. Northward heat transport in atmosphere
6. Strong spatial and seasonal variability
7. Surface fluxes upward during winter and downward during summer
8. Arctic haze
### The Arctic Ocean
1. Shelf seas have key roles in climate
2. Several gyre circulations associated with sea floor bathymetry
### The Nordic Seas
1. Densest waters are produced in Greenland Sea, primarily by open ocean convection 
2. Deep convection rare since 1980s, leading to a 2-layer structure in Greenland Sea 
3. The East Greenland Current is the main export route for sea ice from Arctic Ocean 
4. Cooling of water in Norwegian Atlantic Current is the main form of direct atmosphere–ocean interaction in the Arctic
### Surface circulation
1. Mainly anticyclonic in Canadian basin (Beaufort Gyre)
2. Mainly cyclonic in Eurasian basin 
3. Ice drift has important impacts on salinity balance and albedo 
### Transport and budget 
1. Inflow of warm, salty water from Atlantic in NAC
2. This region often ice-free, with major air–sea exchange
3. Ice export into the North Atlantic is important for global heat and freshwater budgets
4. Net import: 9.5 Sv of light (surface) water
5. Net export: 3.5 Sv of light water and 6 Sv of dense water 
6. Freshwater import via precipitation, rivers and runoff, and inflow from Bering Strait 
### Sea Ice
1. Ice thickens by freezing at the lower interface as heat is conducted from water through ice to atmosphere
2. Snow cover on top of ice inhibits freezing 
3. Freezing process is different for fresh and lowsalinity water compared to seawater
4. Layer of cold, fresh water at the surface of the
Arctic Ocean (strong halocline) -> stable
5. Freezing occurs relatively quickly
6. Fresh water mainly from runoff / river outflow
### The Arctic Atmosphere
1. Atmosphere over Arctic Ocean gains energy during summer and loses energy during winter
2. Compensated by an increase in northward energy transport in the atmosphere (increased eddy activity) and an increase in the surface energy flux into the atmosphere (sea ice growth)
3. Atmosphere gains heat when sea ice forms; ocean gains heat when sea ice melts
